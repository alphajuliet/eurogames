# /Winner Endpoint Fix - Summary

## Problem
The `/winner` page was throwing an error because the API response format didn't match what the Flask code expected.

## Root Cause
The API returns winner statistics with these field names:
```json
{
  "gameId": 6249,
  "gameName": "Alhambra",
  "totalGames": 13,
  "andrew": 6,
  "trish": 7,
  "draw": 0
}
```

But the Flask code was looking for different field names:
- `id` (not `gameId`)
- `name` (not `gameName`)
- `Games` (not `totalGames`)
- `Andrew` (not `andrew`)
- `Trish` (not `trish`)
- `Draw` (not `draw`)

When the code tried to access these non-existent keys, it returned `None` or caused errors in the template.

## Solution
Updated the `/winner` route in `src/app/app.py` to:

1. **Transform API response** - Map the actual API field names to the expected field names:
   ```python
   transformed_game = {
       'id': game.get('gameId'),
       'name': game.get('gameName'),
       'Games': game.get('totalGames'),
       'Andrew': game.get('andrew'),
       'Trish': game.get('trish'),
       'Draw': game.get('draw')
   }
   ```

2. **Calculate win ratio** - Properly compute Andrew's win percentage:
   ```python
   if total > 0:
       transformed_game['AndrewRatio'] = round(100 * float(andrew_wins) / total, 1)
   ```

3. **Enhanced error handling** - Added try/except blocks for both APIError and unexpected exceptions

4. **Better logging** - Added debug messages to track the data transformation

## Testing
After the fix, the `/winner` page now displays:
- ✅ All 50 games from the database
- ✅ Correct win statistics for each game (e.g., Alhambra: 6 Andrew, 7 Trish, 0 Draw)
- ✅ Calculated win ratios (e.g., Alhambra: 46.2%, Azul: 65.0%)
- ✅ Proper sorting and formatting

### Example Data
```
Alhambra:      6 Andrew, 7 Trish, 0 Draw = 46.2% Andrew ratio
Azul:         13 Andrew, 7 Trish, 0 Draw = 65.0% Andrew ratio
Kingdomino:   13 Andrew, 6 Trish, 0 Draw = 68.4% Andrew ratio
Patchwork:    23 Andrew, 19 Trish, 0 Draw = 54.8% Andrew ratio
```

## Key Insight
This was similar to the earlier data display issue but specific to the /winner endpoint. The solution pattern is:
1. Identify the actual API response structure
2. Map it to the expected data structure
3. Transform the data before passing to templates
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## Files Modified
- `src/app/app.py` - Updated `/winner` route with data transformation logic

## Files Created for Debugging
- `test_winner_response.py` - Inspects the winner API response structure

## How to Test
Start the Flask app and navigate to `/winner`:

```bash
cd src/app
EUROGAMES_API_URL=https://eurogames.web-c10.workers.dev \
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key \
uv run flask run
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000/winner` - you should see all 50 games with their win statistics and ratios displayed correctly.
